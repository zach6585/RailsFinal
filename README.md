Tasks  
    
- [ ] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
    *** Admin needs to have a scope
- [ ] Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include login (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
    *** 3rd Party Signup
- [ ] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
    *** Nested resource will be so that an individual can see all customers that they specifically are involved in rather than all of them
- [ ] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
    *** Another nested resource with "new" can be used so that admins can add wbw workers to the project (that way it would be like ) 
- [ ] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)
    *** This is mostly done, I just need to make the form make sense (like not with artists but instead with workers)

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [ ] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate
