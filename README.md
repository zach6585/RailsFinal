This project utilizes the office 365/microsoft azure omniauth2 gem to sign in. Once you sign in, depending on if you're an admin or not, you will be able to see customers (relationships) according to certain rules. If you're an admin, you can see all customers. If you're not, you can only see the customers that you're assigned to. Within those, you can change the notes, with each note being shown on the page. You can also delete the customer as a whole, but only if you're an admin. The app also has logout functionality through the omniauth gem. Since the workers are the ones with accounts, they have ownership over customers. The contacts are from other companies and therefore do not have access to this information at all. On top of that, you can make new customers no matter your credentials, but editing customers, contacts, and workers, as well as creating customers and workers, are only functions admins have. This can all be accomplished through forms.
